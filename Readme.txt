String Similarity - 

String Similarity (25 Points)

For two strings A and B, we define the similarity of the strings to be the length of the longest prefix common to both strings. For example, the similarity of strings "abc" and "abd" is 2, while the similarity of strings "aaa" and "aaab" is 3.

Calculate the sum of similarities of a string S with each of it's suffixes.

Input:
The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains a string each.

Output:
Output T lines containing the answer for the corresponding test case.
